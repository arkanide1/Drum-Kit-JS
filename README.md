### Description:

The Drum-Kit-JS project is an interactive web application that allows users to create music by pressing corresponding keys on their keyboard. Each key (q, s, d, f, g, h, j, k, l, m) triggers a unique drum sound, providing an engaging and dynamic musical experience.

### Features:
- **Keyboard Interaction:** Users can easily play drum sounds by pressing the designated keys, offering a hands-on and intuitive interface.
